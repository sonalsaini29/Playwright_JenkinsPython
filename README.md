### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### ✅ Python + Playwright Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   cd Playwright_JenkinsPython
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Run tests manually**:
   ```bash
   python tests/Stuttgart_Appointment/appoint_eAT.py
   ```

---

### 📦 requirements.txt

```txt
playwright
pytest
```

Add other libraries as needed.

---

### 🧾 .gitignore

```gitignore
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
playwright-report/
```

---

### 🤖 Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Install dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    python -m venv venv
                    source venv/bin/activate
                    pip install -r requirements.txt
                    playwright install
                '''
            }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    source venv/bin/activate
                    python tests/Stuttgart_Appointment/appoint_eAT.py
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```
